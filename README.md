# Handwritten Digit-Recognition

1. Data Preparation and Exploration
Used the MNIST database, standardized the images and converted the images into a multi-dimensional matrix. Perform exploratory analysis of the data.

2. Building and training the Neural Network
Created a Convolutional Neural Network model, 3 layers with ReLu activation & a 4th output layer with LogSoftmax activation. Optimized the model & with each epoch observed a gradual decrease in training loss.

3. Testing and Evaluation
Iterated through the validation set, passed images to the trained model & calculated the total number of correct predictions. The model works with an accuracy of 97%.
